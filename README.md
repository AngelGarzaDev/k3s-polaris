# k3s-polaris

This is a K3S deployment of Polaris I created. The docker deployment and documentation I used to create this deployment can be found [here](https://github.com/ogarcia/docker-polaris).)

This deployment is specific to my environment and does not contain any variables, it will most likely require some changes to work in your environment. 
You can find additional documentation on my environemnt and how to easily replicate it [here](https://github.com/techno-tim/k3s-ansible)
